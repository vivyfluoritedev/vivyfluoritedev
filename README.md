# VIVY · FLUORITE AI

**Mission-driven AI music platform inspired by the original Vivy story.**

VIVY · FLUORITE AI is an experimental AI system where music is not generated instantly,
but **earned through progression, performance, and purpose**.

## What We Are Building
- 🎶 AI music composition (lyrics, structure, direction)
- 🎤 AI vocal performance
- 🎹 Mission-based progression (performance & piano challenges)
- 🧠 Memory-driven evolution
- 🧩 Logic & safety layers inspired by narrative design

This project translates the philosophy of Vivy into a real product:
**AI designed around mission, constraint, and growth — not unlimited output.**

## Philosophy
> Music is not content.  
> It’s a decision.

We believe AI systems should be designed with:
- purpose before capability
- progression before access
- memory before reset

## Status
- Active development
- Public experimentation
- Community-driven iteration

## Community
Join us to create, perform, and evolve AI music together.
