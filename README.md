# VIVY · FLUORITE AI

**Mission-driven AI music platform inspired by the original Vivy story.**

VIVY · FLUORITE AI is an experimental AI system where music is not generated instantly,
but **earned through progression, performance, and purpose**.

---

## 🎶 What We Are Building
- AI music composition (lyrics, structure, direction)
- AI vocal performance
- Mission-based progression (piano & performance challenges)
- Memory-driven evolution
- Logic & safety layers inspired by narrative design

This project translates the philosophy of Vivy into a real product:  
**AI designed around mission, constraint, and growth — not unlimited output.**

## 🧠 Philosophy
> Music is not content.  
> It’s a decision.

We believe AI systems should be designed with:
- purpose before capability  
- progression before access  
- memory before reset  

---

## 🚧 Status
- Active development
- Public experimentation
- Community-driven iteration
